About : This is a Vanilla Js Api working without Express. Its faster than the Express Js api but more complex to make as there are no middleware or any other pre-defined methods which we get in express. Implimented the basic CRUD operations in this application.

For getting all items just add "/api/data" to the url and for specific item using id just add "/api/data/id" to the url.
